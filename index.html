                <p>There are always good years and bad years for aviation, as the below table of fatalities since 1995 shows. </p>
                <p>In good years, there are less than 100 deaths.</p>
                <p>But in bad years such as 2015, there were 1013 world wide.</p>
                <p>There seems to be a general trend of increasing fatalities, but when considering the number of people flying everyday, that number is miniscule.</p>

            <p>Below is a pie chart that shows the likelihood of the types of trouble an airplane might run into.</p>
            <p>There are three categories: fatal, non-fatal, and incident. A fourth "unavailable" category is simply from no data</p>
            <p>The number of fatal crashes is just a sliver of out of all the problems airplanes run into.</p>
            <p>While flying, it's most likely you will not perish.</p>
